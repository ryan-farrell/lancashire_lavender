## Brief

[LancashireLavender.com](https://LancashireLavender.com)

We were tasked with creating a website to display not only the beauty of lavender but it's sustainability and benefits to people’s health. Show case the ethics behind lavender and the products that are available. Look to use modern design with parallax scrolling efficient navigation and a section about the owners.
