## Brief

[LancashireLavender.com](https://LancashireLavender.com)

We were tasked with creating a website to display not only the beauty of lavender but it's sustainability and benefits to peopleâ€™s health. Show case the ethics behind lavender and the products that are available. Look to use modern design with parallax scrolling efficient navigation and a section about the owners.
